/*
This file contains the functions you will modify in order to complete the labs.
These functions allow you to perform DSP on a per-frame or per-sample basis.
When processing on a per-sample basis, there are separate functions for left and right channels.
When processing on a per-frame basis, the left and right channels are interleaved.
The sample rate and frame size can be modified in lab.h.
You can also configure which of the four functions are active in lab.h
